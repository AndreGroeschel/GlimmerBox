## About

### Purpose

GlimmerBox is not intended to be a fully-featured production app. Instead, it serves as a learning tool to demonstrate the practical application of software engineering principles. It showcases the following principles:

- **Scalability:** How to structure the app's architecture to handle growth and maintainability.
- **Clean Code:** Maintaining code quality and readability.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Writing tests to ensure reliability.
- **Dependency Injection:** Creating flexible and testable code.
- **Null Safety:** Avoiding runtime errors with proper null safety.
- **Functional Reactive Programming (FRP):** Efficient management of complex interactions and data flows.
- **Immutability:** The importance of immutability in functional reactive programming.
- **Error Handling:** Handling errors effectively with a functional approach using Either.

### App Features

GlimmerBox interacts with OpenSea's API to fetch and display NFT collections. It serves as a gallery viewer where users can explore collections and individual NFTs.
